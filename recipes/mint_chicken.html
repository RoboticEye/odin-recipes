            A favorite family recipe that my Mom has made for hundreds of guests. <br>
            Fresh lemon juice and mint leaves are a must! Serve over hot cooked white rice.

        <ol>
            <li> In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. <br> Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.<br> <br></li>
            <li> Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat.<br> Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover<br> and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Do not<br> over cook the chicken or it will be tough. </li>
